#python uses print() function to display output

x = "Hello, World!"
print(x)

#to print multiple variables, we can use commas or plus sign (+) to separate them

y = "code"
z = "in Python"
zx = "fun"
print(y, z, zx)  # Using commas
print(y + " " + z + " " + zx)  # Using plus sign (+)

# the + sign also works as math operator if used with numbers
a = 5
b = 10
print(a + b)
